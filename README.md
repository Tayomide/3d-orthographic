# 3d Orthographic

This is a demo to serve as a proof of concept for EG 325 final project idea

# What it does

The goal of 3d Orthographic is to provide a visual aid on converting 3d models to orthographic projections for students taking EG 325 and EG 225.

# How to use

You can either play around with the default model provided or upload your own ```.stl``` 3d model.

# Plans for the future

The results from this demo has proven it has a solid idea behind it and I plan on expanding on this in the future
- Work with Engineering students to provide more 3d models for visual aid
- Provide an option for students to see model with/without the dotted lines
- Add center lines and other visual representations required for orthographic projection
- Integrate hand control movement for a more immersive experience
- Fix Bugs
